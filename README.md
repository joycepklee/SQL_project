# SQL_project
A project using SQL qeuries to analyse company sales data and answer some business questions in Jupyter Notebook. This project connects to a SQLite database called Chinook.db. 
Chinook is a music records company and I analysed the data containing tracks information and invoices to help management decide on buying and marketing strategies in future. The projects include the following parts:

(1) Overview of the Data
(2) Selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, in the best interest of the company, from the following list of tracks: 
Artist Name,	Genre
Regal, Hip-Hop
Red Tone,	Punk
Meteor and the Girls,	Pop
Slim Jim Bites,	Blues
(3) Analyzing Employee Sales Performance: to evaluate total sales supported by employees
(4) Analyzing Sales by Country: to discover countries worth future focus on marketing 
(5) Business recommendation to the company: is buying albums or individual tracks a better strategy?

Thanks for watching and I welcome any comments.
